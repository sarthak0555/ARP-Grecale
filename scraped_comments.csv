EDZ,"Grecale -v- Macan by an Owner of Both.

This comparison is all written in my own honest opinion and having owned Porsche Macan’s (SD, S and GTS) for over eight years prior to collecting my Grecale Trofeo Primaserie. This comparison is jumping straight out of a Macan GTS (which I had been driving for 18 months prior) into my Grecale Trofeo Primaserie, having now owned the Grecale for three weeks.
I very much appreciate that all views and opinions are individual and subjective to everyone, and I am not looking for a debate on my opinions, just quoting them, as a few members on the forum have asked for them.

The Grecale is very much on par if not slightly better comfort wise, the fit and finish both internal and external is better on the Grecale, the quality of materials internally are far superior to the Macan, far less plastic. The steering wheel stock (indicators etc) exude quality rather than cheap plastic VW parts bin on the Macan, seat, and head rest backs full quality leather rather than plastic on Macan, in fact almost everything is leather in the Grecale and so much not leather in the Macan. Space inside the Grecale is outstanding and far greater than the Macan especially for rear passengers, my adult kids keep saying how comfortable they are now in the rear and have so much more of a luxury feel and the heated seats and individual touch screen climate controls adds even more to that feel. As for the Sonus Faber 21 speaker, 1285w surround 3D stereo system, this is fantastic and far better than the Burmester top end Porsche stereo (at an extra cost by Porsche of over £3600.00) I had in the Macan. The pedal position is better in the Grecale more comfortable, takes a while in a Macan at first to get comfortable due to the protruding lump in the gearbox tunnel pushing into that area, which would make a long drive uncomfortable occasionally for me.
So many little thoughtful touches in the Grecale but not in a Macan, such as being able to put down rear seats from both inside the boot/trunk and also in car rear, door handles lighting up on entry at night, complete stereo, volume, channel, next track controls on back of steering wheel etc ect. Tech wise the Grecale is in a world apart from the Macan, who’s tech is so dated now and so yesterday.

To sum up both internally and externally the Grecale exudes elegance, style and quality with a touch of modernism, and so up to date tech wise, whereas the Macan is so dated now unfortunately all round, even after a couple of little face lifts over the last nine years, and too much plastic / leatherette, and far more cheap looking black plastic externally now on the Gen 3 Macan.

Performance “WOW”! This is something that stands head and shoulders above the Macan, you do not expect such grunt the first couple of times you put your foot down especially in sport and corsa modes. The sound and feel are so much more theatrical, and power feels more like 590hp than the 530hp quoted, the car encourages you and it really does not feel like an SUV when throwing it around. The steering, though just a tad light for me, but very precise and you soon get to know it, braking is good and confident no fad, this is a real drivers car, don’t get me wrong the Macan GTS is a good car but more of a anyone can drive feel (even Miss Daisy herself), you don’t get that theatrical feel or as much feeling that you are in a real performance car with the Macan.

You definitely would not be disappointed with the Grecale Trofeo, in the way it goes, its power, steering and stopping its right up there with some of the very best, a true driver’s car with so much theatre, sound and feel and forgetting that you are in an SUV.

The comfort levels you can obtain by changing varying parameters in suspension is good both around town, open roads and even twisty county lanes, though I must say on the UK’s bad roads apart from a few, in corsa mode you need to select soft damper mode as in hard it can be a little rough, but on track if you so wish I’m sure hard mode would be perfect. Having now played with varying setting it is easy to select what you need or want for your own required comfort levels, and for me it covers all of them areas perfectly.

My Conclusion: The Grecale beats the Macan easily on almost every level and I am so happy that I took the plunge and turned my back on the Macan. Sorry Porsche but having owed one of your cars in differing model for the last 16 years and Macan’s for the last 8 years, you have lost a customer, who regrets the change to a Grecale not one little bit.

And I must say despite reading on this forum of owners having tech issues etc, so far, my car has been great with no issues whatsoever, long may that last. I now come to expect tech issues and updates are and were required as I had many of them, and even one only two days before getting the Grecale on my past Macan’s.

Thanks for reading and hope it will be a little help to anyone contemplating buying a Grecale or. and thinking of moving away from a Macan."

Will do 

And then best you don't read the Macan forum as they have just as many issues if not more, some of which have been on going for a couple of years and repeat themselves, along with mechanical issues as well. Leaking pano roofs, rear washer failure filling rear cabin with water, transfer box failure, timing chain covers leaking oil, failing ABS sensors, panel miss alignment when car gets hot, etc etc. Porsche have also removed several things from the Macan and not replaced, such as no electric steering column anymore back to manual, to name but one. All modern technology just like your mobile phone unfortunately get bugs and require regular updates and fixing etc, As I have said earlier. ! the Porsche Macan has been out for over nine years and stlll has issues, both electronically and mechanically, as do many other manufacturers."

Hi edit.

I've had Cayenne, 718 Cayman, 718 boxer and 911's. I'm getting to old to get in and out of low sports cars now, and not many are comfortable on long journeys either and the Cayenne was a little on the large size for my liking. I now only have the one all rounder car, rather than a two car garage, although my other half does have a Mini Cooper S."
GrecaleNYC,"Nice to see you here on this forum @EDZ, (I’m “macanS” on the Macan forum, joined Dec. 2013), and thanks for your review.
I’ve been eyeing the Grecale for many months now and have been driving my Macan S since July 2014. The trofeo is a big price jump from the Modena so I’m hoping I can make that leap. Performance wise, I’m sure I’ll be “satisfied” with Modena as compared to my now aging Macan, but the overall upgrade in build and design of the Maserati is nice to hear about from a long time Macan owner like yourself.
Time will tell what will happen with my next car purchase, I’ll keep you posted!"

Hi GrecaleNYC

The Modena is also a great car and has just as much luxury and tech, I'm sure you would not be disappointed with that either.

What I do hear from a lot of GTS Macan owners is ""Look at the price difference so expensive"" . Believe me I have done a comparison with regards to price before ordering the Grecale Trofeo against the Macan GTS. 

To spec a Macan GTS anywhere near to the Grecale Trefeo and that included taking some prices of extras from the Cayenne as some items you just can not even spec on a Macan, it came out at 103k in the UK and still did not have everything that the Grecale comes with especially tech wise. Then you have to remember the Grecale price quoted comes with 3 year services, includes on the road (VED) and 3 year connectivity, road map navigation updates etc in the UK, which would add another 5k to the Macan price in the UK, as Porsche don't include these in their price, this takes the Macan GTS to around 108k. Next you have to look at the engine and power difference, if Porsche still did the Turbo Macan and could give it 530bhp the uplift (extra) in starting basic price going by the difference between Macan, T, S and GTS would be another 12k aprox, so this would make the Macan in the region of 120k which is actually far more than the top spec Trofeo with every extra added.

The next thing they throw at you is depreciation !! Depreciation figures are normally calculated on basic standard MRP of cars, and no matter what Porsche you buy one has to spend at least another 10k to even get basic luxuries that most other manufactures include, So if you were to buy A Macan spec as near to a Trefeo as poss aprox cost 120K the depreciation figure would also be the same as the Trefeo at least, IMO.

When looking at a genuine price comparisons like for like the Grecale is easily on par with the Porsche Macan, but the Grecale is in my opinion worth a little extra for the better luxury you get and more of a rare car than the mass marketed Macan."
John,"Interesting and helpful thank you. I am looking at Grecale at this time to replace my 3 yr old Macan S, and as you have mentioned the new Macan a bit behind other makers."

Hi edit.

Only got back to UK early hours of yesterday but hopefully the following pics give you an idea."
John,I didn’t think a few millimetres would be that much different in looks but it shows quite a bit. 🤙
edit,"so, picture 1 is normal position, then aero one, then parking, then offroad one?

a little bit difficult for me to spot the difference between picture 2 and 3.

@John , I ordered the air suspension only because the looks in aero one setting, as this is the way I will drive it always.

btw, @EDZ, for instance, if you select aero 1, then you stop the car, the next day the journey will start in aero 1, or will reverse to normal position?

So, my car that entered production on 17th of April is delayed for delivery until further notice ))"

For lowest parking height you have to set in the Hud for it to activate, so it's switchable to your own liking. I believe everything reverts back to normal when you switch off and return later or next day.
Obviously not possible to show lowest Aero 2 as this is self activating at speed, but I'm led to believe its the same as the lowest parking setting."

Sounds like adjustability of suspension better than Macan as well."
WarrenB,"It has a setting that allows you to set the car to lower itself to its lowest height (aero 2) when the car is in park and on level ground. Mine doesn’t always work however. Like a lot in this car, there are a lot of quirks and defects that is going to take them a while to sort out so it’s going to mean a lot of trips to the dealer for most people. My dealer told me that some people did around 20 trips to the dealer when they released the Ghibli.

It’s a great design and I love the interior, but it’s a quirky drive and the tech is a little dated or lacking compared to its competitors releases this year. The HUD is average at best, no self no parking, no parking reverse from phone app, no virtual reality navigation, no draggable 360 surround view or zoom function, camera quality is awful, reverse camera parking lines and sensor beeping is as bad as it is in our 2017 Ghibli where it beeps like crazy even though you are a mile from the curb. The only thing the Grecale has new as far as tech that our 2017 Ghibli doesn’t have is the 360 camera view. It’s same old in a much nicer UI with a better quality screen. There is a lot of good quality like the leather but some awful quality like the glossy buttons on the doors and steering wheel And what’s with the backlit buttons that are extremely dim and off when the car is off. I’m tired of having to remind valet’s where the start button is because it doesn’t show when the car is off!

Many say the Success of the Grecale is going to be the difference between death or survival for Maserati as they expect 80% of their sales to come from it, but is it good enough at the price point to take sales away from Porsche, BMW and Mercedes? I’ve had so many issues with mine that it’s currently going through the repurchase process.
