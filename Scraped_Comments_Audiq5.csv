Hoggy,"I'm going to stop reading this forum, there are a lot of Q5's with problems if you read all the topics.

When you consider how few Q5's are out there, to have so many problems mentioned is a bit worrying.

I am amazed how many members seem to take their problems so calmly, wondering if they should take it back to the dealers or not. The answer is YES, and make a song and dance about it to ensure that Audi know about the problems and get them sorted at the factory.

Just remember that the Audi Technicians have a really tough job now, these cars are so complicated, so go easy on these guys!

If everybody just excepts that they all do it mentality - things will never get sorted!

Any thoughts?

Hi Hoggy

So pleased you started this thread as I am of the same mind. At first I used to read how the Q5 is so popular that the supply was outstripped by demand. Now we see on a too regular basis all of these problems, some of which are quite concerning.
Are we seeing a marketing stratergy where supply is artificialy restricted so as to create a demand?. Audi are well known for this. Is the production for the Q5 now being rushed and quality is suffering? 
This is a real concern, as after now a 5 month wait and still no build date confirmed, will we end up with a car of dubious quality. Perhaps we should cut our losses now and stick with MB. At least they take customer service seriously and not just give lip service!
I agree with you, If you have a problem with your Q5 give Audi hell and let Jeremy Hicks know that you are not happy."

Hi Hoggy,

I agree entirely - bombard Audi UK with the problems. If they don't know it's broken they can't fix it.

Cheers,

Kev"
Hoggy,"It doesn't strike me that there are loads of issues on the Q5? Are there?

imho...No car is completely without issues. I've been with MB and LR. MB had some faults too but LR were the worst because they designed the faults in but then couldn't fix them....so they changed the fault to call it a Characteristic that once out of warranty would cost circa ?300 to fix 3 or 4 times a year.....now that's what I call a problem. Glad I sold it now"

Hoggy, I've got to agree with Zara here having had no faults whatsover with the car.
Having said that it's only a month since I've taken delivery of it so there's plenty of time and miles for things to go wrong.
Apart from the fact that Audi failed to fit the B&O speakers I'd specced along with the curious way it has of moving away from stationary everything else seems pretty well screwed together.
The only issue I have is that driving it is a very bland experience..."
nsm3,"I agree with Zara even though I've not got one yet.....I just searched the internet and struggled to find very much reported on there.

I did find something about the Q5 though which may be linked to a couple of recent posts about vibration.........

QUOTE.....Hi my name is XXX. XX% of vibration problems while driving are tire induced. Most common problems come from tire rubber compounds and subjective situations. Like how long the vehicle sits.

Your tires are a blend of a relatively soft rubber compound (for more grip) and a more aggressive tread pattern (for traction) and are more susceptible to becoming out of round (shaped like an egg). Bridgestone is one of the manufacturers that we have more tire oscillation then others. Audi will require that all the tires be road force balanced and the entire vehicle be inspected before they even consider looking at tire replacement. Which they almost never do.

Audi has a 9 page bulletin that describes how tires go out of round and how it is normal.

It will depend on how many miles you have on your current tires.

To answer your question, YES. There are some, not many, complaints about tire vibration with Bridgestone Dueler H/P's.

Thank you XXX XXXXXXXX Just Answer,

Joe.

Wow sounds like a reply from Audi marketing department!!!"
Kaine,"No complaints about mine so far (1500 miles) - it seems very well put together to me? I will of course be the first to moan if that changes, but that is what warranty is for?

As to it being a bland drive, well it is an SUV after all and I assume everyone test drives before buying? My other daily drive is a Lotus, so plenty of differences (pretty much the other end of the car spectrum), but I still enjoy cruising about in the Q5."

Its my third audi now and i've not had a single problem with any of them.

Have to agree that it is not exactly the most responsive car i've ever driven, but for cruising around and taking it easy i find it a relaxing drive and also very quiet. I suppose if you were after a 'thrilling ride' then you wouldn't be buying an SUV."
windmill,"these are great threads - thanks for starting it Hoggy

Forums are known hubs to discuss problems - this is what makes them so useful to everyone who joins - not only does it help you resolve a problem you already have, it helps you recognise what is 'a problem' and not a 'characteristic' as Josh mentioned. I think without www.rrsport.co.uk many RRS owners would be fobbed off with the 'suspension knocking noise on the RRS' as a characteristic - as it happens there is a massive amount of info on the problem and the fix - most members print of the forum posts to enable them to discuss with LR dealer Service departments.

The Q5 is going to have problems, however so far I've not noticed a common theme (unless I'm missing something) - this is a good sign really. Of course the niggle/problem is a pain for the owner, but at least we know every car of the production line doesn't have it. When the Touareg was launched they had major issues with tracking alignment meaning most people struggled to get to 10k on the first set of tyres (me included) - it took some time to get it resolved.

I'm sure we'll return to this topic periodically, however so far to me the Q5 reliability is looking good
