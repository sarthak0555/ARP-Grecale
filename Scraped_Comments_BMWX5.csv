Guest Mister Dabsy,"I have been personally contacted and been given exclusive access to important information regarding the X5 and the potential threat of these vehicles been stolen with quite some ease...It has always been a known fact that the early X5 and Mini had their Engine and Security modules in the engine bay, this made it very easy to compromise via access to the bonnet through the grilles. Thieves would then replace the unit for a recoded version accompanied with a blank key to steal the car. BMW were made aware of this and recalled the X5 somewhat quietly... The module(s) were relocated into the occupancy area in the hope this would erradicate the issue...Alas, it did not. The glass was vulnerable in such a way that it wouldn't activate the security system...Our source has directly contacted BMW to seek assurances that the module(s) be placed more securely AND that tighter checks are done when issuing new ""blank"" keys -  Registration Documents at least.This issue of stolen X5's (and Mini's) is on the increase in the UK.I would like all our members to contact their local dealer and request that their vehicle be accepted into the apparent unpublicised Recall..."
Guest Mister Dabsy,"omg i can see a new x5 on my drive in a few days lolfor bmw not to do a major recal over something as big as this is strange, if u have ur x5 / mini stolen can u claim against bmw as its a known security issue ?????????"
kirby williams,That is a scenario that certain establishments are trying to resolve.
kirby williams,everyone shoud post their thoughts.. it will get picked up!
Guest Mister Dabsy,"Yes your insurers pay,and no BMW are not liable,"
Guest Mister Dabsy,"Thats seems to be the case Ian, once you buy the car thats it !!"
Steve,"I can verify this tomorrow, as per ""Recall"" if this helps anyone...If anyone has doubts about their X5 or Mini then please PM me with your LAST-SEVEN Vin digits...DAZ"
Steve,So what does this recal involve ... Mind you they would beep pretty small fingers to get in through my mesh grills
IanIOM,"No Chris, it's easy to open a BMW bonnet - They remove the near-side grille and make a small cut into the cowling to expose the latch !!"

Guest Mister Dabsy,So what do they do in the recall
Guest Mister Dabsy,"bit pantsNo Chris, it's easy to open a BMW bonnet - They remove the near-side grille and make a small cut into the cowling to expose the latch !!thats a bit pants!"
Guest Mister Dabsy,"Who remembers the good old days.....sticky tape over the window,brick,slid hammer and a flat head screw driver.Dabsy taught me officer"
Guest Mister Dabsy,"Oooooh Slide-hammer, now there's a tool !! Old skool n all lol"
prestige interiors,LOL... dabs will be selling coat hooks in the store soon! LOL
prestige interiors,"(Note to Self) Must keep mi Gob shut so not to encourage smackheads into nicking cars !!BMW community will be watching the smackheads tonite, and issuing retribution !"
Guest Mister Dabsy,"No old school was bend the door back,lean in,unlock,get in,bend door back drive off"
Guest Mister Dabsy,sounds like an X5 is easier than that LOL
Guest Mister Dabsy,For me it was wait for dad to fall asleep take keys race the nuts off his pride and joy once we left school the novelty wore off
Guest Mister Dabsy,"However Steve you need the right gear to do this,you have to be a bit of a whos kid to make it.i wouldnt worry to much if I owned a x5.it will be there in the morning"
prestige interiors,"BUMP...I WAS a geezer in the eighties and learned alot,,, Now, it seems, BMW needs to learn about their customers !"
prestige interiors,"Just to add... There was a recall in 2006, which expired some 3yrs later in Spring 2009... Any owner that contacted their dealer AFTER this time could not qualify due to the presumption that the vehicle had changed hands...""Presumptions"" were always at BMW's (Europe) descretion. If, and only if, you can prove you are the sole owner from New, then they will consider a re-fit.In my opinion this is wrong, but a step in the right direction...Data obtained (22/03/12) via Sandal..."

	That's a bit naff, my BMW has probably had a few owners but if the vulnerability is still there it's still there no matter how many owners has been through"
